Soon after the superior performance of Wav2Vec2 was demonstrated on one of the most popular English datasets for ASR, called [LibriSpeech](https://huggingface.co/datasets/librispeech_asr), *Facebook AI* presented a multi-lingual version of Wav2Vec2, called [XLSR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13979). XLSR stands for *cross-lingual speech representations* and refers to model's ability to learn speech representations that are useful across multiple languages.\n\nXLSR's successor, simply called **XLS-R** (refering to the [*''XLM-R*](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/-xlm-r-state-of-the-art-cross-lingual-understanding-through-self-supervision/) *for Speech''*), was released in [November 2021](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/xls-r-self-supervised-speech-processing-for-128-languages) by *Arun Babu, Changhan Wang, Andros Tjandra, et al.* XLS-R used almost **half a million** hours of audio data in 128 languages for self-supervised pre-training and comes in sizes ranging from 300 milion up to **two billion** parameters. You can find the pretrained checkpoints on the 🤗 Hub:\n\n- [**Wav2Vec2-XLS-R-300M**](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-xls-r-300m)\n- [**Wav2Vec2-XLS-R-1B**](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-xls-r-1b)\n- [**Wav2Vec2-XLS-R-2B**](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-xls-r-2b)\n\nSimilar to [BERT's masked language modeling objective](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/), XLS-R learns contextualized speech representations by randomly masking feature vectors before passing them to a transformer network during self-supervised pre-training (*i.e.* diagram on the left below). \n\nFor fine-tuning, a single linear layer is added on top of the pre-trained network to train the model on labeled data of audio downstream tasks such as speech recognition, speech translation and audio classification (*i.e.* diagram on the right below).\n\n![wav2vec2_structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patrickvonplaten/scientific_images/master/xls_r.png)\n\nXLS-R shows impressive improvements over previous state-of-the-art results on both speech recognition, speech translation and speaker/language identification, *cf.* with Table 3-6, Table 7-10, and Table 11-12 respectively of the official [paper](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/xls-r-self-supervised-speech-processing-for-128-languages).","metadata":{"id":"V7YOT2mnUiea"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"gpu_info = !nvidia-smi\ngpu_info = '\\n'.join(gpu_info)\nif gpu_info.find('failed') >= 0:\n    print('Not connected to a GPU')\nelse:\n    print(gpu_info)","metadata":{"id":"YELVqGxMxnbG","outputId":"1ab7eb67-409d-4371-b99e-7eb1171cb5fb","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-07-02T00:58:22.7191Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-07-02T00:58:22.719485Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-07-02T00:58:22.788573Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-07-02T00:58:22.719449Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-07-02T00:58:22.787444Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%%capture\n!pip install datasets\n!pip install transformers\n!pip install torchaudio\n!pip install jiwer","metadata":{"id":"c8eh87Hoee5d","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-07-02T00:58:22.790106Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-07-02T00:58:22.790759Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-07-02T00:58:59.461879Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-07-02T00:58:22.79072Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-07-02T00:58:59.460676Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Prepare Data, Tokenizer, Feature Extractor","metadata":{"id":"0mW-C1Nt-j7k"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"ASR models transcribe speech to text, which means that we both need a feature extractor that processes the speech signal to the model's input format, *e.g.* a feature vector, and a tokenizer that processes the model's output format to text. \n\nIn 🤗 Transformers, the XLS-R model is thus accompanied by both a tokenizer, called [Wav2Vec2CTCTokenizer](https://huggingface.co/transformers/master/model_doc/wav2vec2.html#wav2vec2ctctokenizer), and a feature extractor, called [Wav2Vec2FeatureExtractor](https://huggingface.co/transformers/master/model_doc/wav2vec2.html#wav2vec2featureextractor).\n\nLet's start by creating the tokenizer to decode the predicted output classes to the output transcription.","metadata":{"id":"BeBosnY9BH3e"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Create `Wav2Vec2CTCTokenizer`","metadata":{"id":"sEXEWEJGQPqD"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Common Voice has many different splits including `invalidated`, which refers to data that was not rated as \"clean enough\" to be considered useful.

In contrast to most NLP models, XLS-R has a much larger input length than output length. *E.g.*, a sample of input length 50000 has an output length of no more than 100.

This is necessary because in speech input and output are of different modalities meaning that they should not be treated by the same padding function.\nAnalogous to the common data collators, the padding tokens in the labels with `-100` so that those tokens are **not** taken into account when computing the loss.","metadata":{"id":"Slk403unUS91"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import torch\n\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\nfrom typing import Any, Dict, List, Optional, Union\n\n@dataclass\nclass DataCollatorCTCWithPadding:\n    \"\"\"\n    Data collator that will dynamically pad the inputs received.\n    Args:\n        processor (:class:`~transformers.Wav2Vec2Processor`)\n            The processor used for proccessing the data.\n        padding (:obj:`bool`, :obj:`str` or :class:`~transformers.tokenization_utils_base.PaddingStrategy`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`True`):\n            Select a strategy to pad the returned sequences (according to the model's padding side and padding index)\n            among:\n            * :obj:`True` or :obj:`'longest'`: Pad to the longest sequence in the batch (or no padding if only a single\n              sequence if provided).\n            * :obj:`'max_length'`: Pad to a maximum length specified with the argument :obj:`max_length` or to the\n              maximum acceptable input length for the model if that argument is not provided.\n            * :obj:`False` or :obj:`'do_not_pad'` (default): No padding (i.e., can output a batch with sequences of\n              different lengths).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    processor: Wav2Vec2Processor\n    padding: Union[bool, str] = True\n\n    def __call__(self, features: List[Dict[str, Union[List[int], torch.Tensor]]]) -> Dict[str, torch.Tensor]:\n        # split inputs and labels since they have to be of different lenghts and need\n        # different padding methods\n        input_features = [{\"input_values\": feature[\"input_values\"]} for feature in features]\n        label_features = [{\"input_ids\": feature[\"labels\"]} for feature in features]\n\n        batch = self.processor.pad(\n            input_features,\n            padding=self.padding,\n            return_tensors=\"pt\",\n        )\n        with self.processor.as_target_processor():\n            labels_batch = self.processor.pad(\n                label_features,\n                padding=self.padding,\n                return_tensors=\"pt\",\n            )\n\n        # replace padding with -100 to ignore loss correctly\n        labels = labels_batch[\"input_ids\"].masked_fill(labels_batch.attention_mask.ne(1), -100)\n\n        batch[\"labels\"] = labels\n\n        return batch","metadata":{"id":"tborvC9hx88e","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-07-02T01:46:43.4471Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-07-02T01:46:43.447904Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-07-02T01:46:43.462404Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-07-02T01:46:43.447867Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-07-02T01:46:43.461446Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data_collator = DataCollatorCTCWithPadding(processor=processor, padding=True)","metadata":{"id":"lbQf5GuZyQ4_","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-07-02T01:46:46.130482Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-07-02T01:46:46.131111Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-07-02T01:46:46.13631Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-07-02T01:46:46.131058Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-07-02T01:46:46.135102Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Next, the evaluation metric is defined.

To save GPU memory, we enable PyTorch's [gradient checkpointing](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/checkpoint.html) and also set the loss reduction to \"*mean*\".\n\n**Note**: When using this notebook the hyper-parameter settings might not work very well. Feel free to adapt those depending on your use case.
